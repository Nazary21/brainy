# Development Progress

Always ensure consistency with [specs.md](specs.md) and update it if we change specs or requirements (carefully, without breaking changes, ask user if unsure).

## Project Initialization (Completed)

- [x] Create and finalize system specifications
- [x] Set up environment variables in Railway
- [x] Determine vector database storage strategy (Railway volume)
- [x] Initialize basic project structure
- [x] Set up Docker configuration
- [x] Create basic Telegram bot integration
- [x] Implement simple message handling

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Modularity (Current Phase)

- [x] Set up core message routing
- [x] Implement basic OpenAI provider adapter
- [x] Create simple memory system with in-memory storage (MVP)
- [x] Implement character system for bot personality management
- [x] Implement essential bot commands
- [x] Integrate memory system with vector storage
- [x] Implement basic module system with Reminder module
- [x] Organize test files in their own directory
- [x] Update Telegram adapter to handle module features (reminders)
- [ ] Add error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] Complete thorough testing of core components

## Next Tasks (Prioritized)

1. **Telegram Integration Enhancements** - Medium Priority
   - Add support for inline keyboards and callback queries
   - Implement message formatting for better user experience
   - Enhance reminder notifications with interactive elements

2. **Logging and Error Handling** - High Priority
   - Enhance logging with proper context information
   - Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
   - Add better error reporting to users through Telegram

3. **Testing and Deployment** - High Priority
   - Complete integration tests for core components
   - Set up Docker deployment with proper volume mounts 
   - Ensure environment variables are properly handled

4. **Database Foundations** - Medium Priority
   - Create database models for users, conversations, and preferences
   - Implement connection and migration logic
   - Start transitioning in-memory storage to database

## Phase 2: Persistent Storage and Enhanced Features (Upcoming)

- [ ] Implement database models for users, conversations, and preferences
- [ ] Create migrations system for database schema
- [ ] Set up persistent storage for conversation history
- [ ] Add webhook support for Telegram adapter
- [ ] Implement user authentication for web dashboard
- [ ] Develop additional modules according to specifications

## Technical Decisions

1. **Vector Database Storage**: Using Railway volume at `/data/vectordb` for initial deployment. ChromaDB has been implemented as the vector database, which allows for semantic search of previous conversations.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set up in Railway project for secure management of API keys and configuration.

3. **Deployment Strategy**: Using Docker container deployed to Railway, with a volume mount for persistent vector database storage.

4. **Project Structure**: Implemented a modular architecture following the specifications, with clear separation between adapters, core components, and utilities.

5. **Logging Strategy**: Using structlog with rich console output for development and JSON formatting for production.

6. **Character System**: Implemented a character system using JSON files to store character definitions, with plans to migrate to database storage in the future.

7. **Memory Management**: Implemented a hybrid approach using in-memory storage for recent conversations and ChromaDB for vector search capabilities, enabling retrieval of relevant context from past conversations.

8. **Module System**: Implemented an extensible module system that enables both command-based and natural language interactions, allowing for easy addition of new functionality.

9. **Development Environment**: Project requires specific Python dependencies including:
   - Rust toolchain for certain package dependencies (chromadb, pydantic-core)
   - Python 3.9+ with venv support
   - Creation of a virtual environment for development
   - Docker for deployment

10. **Telegram Integration**: Integrated Telegram adapter with the module system to handle command processing and natural language triggers, with specific support for reminders.

## Completed Components

1. **OpenAI Provider Adapter**: Implemented a flexible adapter for the OpenAI API with support for chat completions and embeddings.

2. **Character System**: Created a character management system that loads character definitions from JSON files and allows switching between different bot personalities.

3. **Memory Manager**: Implemented a conversation storage system with both in-memory and vector storage capabilities, enabling semantic search across conversation history.

4. **Conversation Handler**: Created a central coordinator that manages the flow of conversations between users and the bot, leveraging the AI provider, character system, and memory manager.

5. **Telegram Adapter**: Enhanced the Telegram adapter to use the conversation handler and character system, allowing users to interact with different bot personalities. Integrated with the module system to support commands and natural language processing.

6. **Vector Store**: Implemented a vector store using ChromaDB for semantic search capabilities, which enhances the bot's ability to recall relevant information from past conversations.

7. **Module System**: Implemented a flexible module system that allows for easy extension of the bot's functionality through pluggable modules, with support for both command and natural language triggers. Currently includes a Reminder module for demonstration purposes.

8. **Reminder Module**: Implemented a module for setting and managing reminders using both commands and natural language processing. Integrated with the Telegram adapter to send reminder notifications.

9. **Test Organization**: Moved all test files to a dedicated `tests` directory for better project organization.
